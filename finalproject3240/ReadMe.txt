
Setup Instructions 
Setup is very simple. Unzip the zip folder, and upload the uncompressed folder to jupyterhub. Open up two terminals WHILE in the folder / make sure the terminals have scope into the folder with the code in it. First, in one terminal, run the commands:


make clean
make
./server 3240


then , in the other terminal run:


./client localhost 3240


Congratulations! You're ready to go! In the terminal you typed the client command in, you can now use the application.
